🧠 Core System Logic:

✔ Attendance → Salary Flow

Admin/Supervisor marks daily attendance

Attendance stored with unique constraint (person_type, person_id, date)

Auto-generate salary uses:

present days

leave days (paid)

absent days (unpaid)

Salary = dailySalary × (present + leave)

If previous salary exists:

If unpaid → update salary

If paid → block update

Salary created once per employee per month
